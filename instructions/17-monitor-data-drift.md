# Monitor Data Drift

## Overview

Changing trends in data over time can reduce the accuracy of the predictions made by a model. Monitoring for this *data drift* and retraining as necessary is an important way to ensure your machine learning solution continues to predict accurately.

## Open Jupyter

While you can use the **Notebooks** page in Azure Machine Learning studio to run notebooks, it's often more productive to use a more fully-featured notebook development environment like *Jupyter*.

> **Tip**: Jupyter Notebook is a commonly used open-source tool for data science. You can refer to the [documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) if you are unfamiliar with it.

1. In the LabVM browser open Azure Machine Learning Studio(https://ml.azure.com). If prompted, login using the credentials provided in the **Environment Details** tab. View the **Compute** page for your workspace.

    **Note**: If you get **Welcome to the studio** page when you login, Select **Subscription** and **Machine Learning workspace** available in the drop down then click on **Get Started**.

2. On the **Compute Instances** tab, start your compute instance if it is not already running.

3. When the compute instance is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab. Be sure to open *Jupyter* and not *JupyterLab*.

## Monitor data drift for a dataset

In this exercise, the code to monitor data drift is provided in a notebook.

1. In the Jupyter home page, browse to the **Users/mslearn-dp100** or **Users/*{Username}*/mslearn-dp100** folder where you cloned the notebook repository.

2. Click on **Monitor Data Drift** (17 - Monitor Data Drift.ipynb) notebook to open in the new tab.

3. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn. To run each cell select and click on **Run** on the menu.

4. When you have finished running the code in the notebook, on the **File** menu, click **Close and Halt** to close it and shut down its Python kernel. Then close all Jupyter browser tabs.
